You adjust your badge as the ER hums around you, organized chaos stitched together by habit and caffeine.\n\nA senior resident watches you from across the bay. Calm. Assessing. Dangerous in a way that has nothing to do with scalpels.\n\nA nurse brushes past you, fingers lingering a beat too long as she hands you gloves. Her eyes say she’s already figured you out.\n\nAnd somewhere down the hall, another intern laughs too loudly — confident, charming, already treating this place like a stage.\n\nYou take a breath. This is where reputations start.\n\n---\n\n**CHOICES**\n1) **Follow the resident** — Shadow the senior resident and show you’re serious about medicine.\n2) **Help the nurse** — Jump in with the ER nurse and earn trust the hard way.\n3) **Challenge the intern** — Keep pace with your rival and refuse to be outshined.\n4) **Stay professional** — Focus on protocols, keep distance, protect your future.",

When you hesitate, she notices.\n\nBetween patients, she leans closer than necessary.\n\n“Don’t slow me down,” she says. It’s not a warning.
