Monitors chirp, stretchers roll, voices overlap like nobody finishes a sentence.\n\nA senior resident cuts through the chaos without breaking stride, orders landing instantly. An ER nurse catches a falling chart with her foot and does not even look down. Down the hall, another intern laughs too loudly, already acting like he belongs.\n\nNo one stops to welcome you. No one should.\n\nYou are expected to step in.\n\n---\n\n**CHOICES**\n1) **Shadow the resident** - You stick close to the senior resident and watch how she commands the room.\n2) **Help the nurse** - You jump in with the ER nurse and take whatever task she throws at you.\n3) **Match the intern** - You fall in alongside the other intern so you are not the weakest link.\n4) **Stick to protocol** - You start with charts and procedures, choosing safety over visibility.",
