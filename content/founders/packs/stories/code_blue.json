Monitors chirping, stretchers rolling, voices overlapping like no one ever finishes a sentence.\n\nA senior resident moves through it all without breaking stride, issuing orders that land instantly. An ER nurse catches a falling chart with her foot and doesn’t even look down. Down the hall, another intern laughs too loudly, already at ease.\n\nNo one stops to welcome you. No one should.\n\nYou’re expected to step in.\n\n---\n\n**CHOICES**\n1) **Shadow the resident** — You stick close to the senior resident, watching how she commands the room and hoping you don’t get in her way.\n2) **Help the nurse** — You jump in with the ER nurse, taking whatever task she throws at you, no questions asked.\n3) **Match the intern** — You fall in alongside the other intern, keeping pace so you’re not the weakest link.\n4) **Stick to protocol** — You start with charts and procedures, choosing safety over visibility.",
