      "text": "Your first real shift hits you in layers: antiseptic, burnt coffee, sweat under disposable gowns. The ER is not chaos the way movies sell it. It is controlled violence. Alarms chirp in patterns you do not recognize yet. Wheels squeal. Voices overlap. Everyone moves like the building itself is pushing them forward.\n\nDr. Adrian Cole. Intern. The title feels flimsy compared to the weight of the room. You adjust your badge as if tightening it will tighten you.\n\nA senior resident cuts through the bay like a blade. She does not waste words. Orders land and people obey. She clocks you once, the way a predator clocks distance, then keeps moving.\n\nAn ER nurse threads between bodies and equipment without slowing down. She catches a falling chart with her foot and never breaks eye contact with the patient she is calming. When she hands you gloves, her fingers linger just long enough to be intentional. Her expression says: do not embarrass yourself.\n\nDown the hall, another intern laughs too loudly. Too comfortable. Too quick to treat the shift like a stage. He throws a look your way like you are either competition or entertainment.\n\nNo one welcomes you. No one should.\n\nYou have a choice: be seen, be useful, or be safe. None of those are free.\n\n----------------\nCHOICES\n1) SHADOW RESIDENT - Stay tight to the senior resident and learn how power moves in this place. You will earn respect if you keep up, but you will also get blamed if you slow her down.\n2) HELP NURSE - Jump in beside the ER nurse and let her put you to work. You will learn the real rhythm of the room fast, but she will notice every weakness and every excuse.\n3) MATCH INTERN - Keep pace with the other intern and refuse to be outshined on day one. You may gain social footing, but rivalry here turns personal quickly.\n4) STICK TO PROTOCOL - Start with charts, procedures, and safe tasks. You protect your future, but you risk becoming invisible at exactly the wrong moment.",

She does not explain. She hands you a chart mid-stride and keeps talking to a respiratory therapist without slowing down.\n\nYou skim while walking. Vitals. History. Allergies. A note from the attending that reads like a warning. The resident glances back once, not at the paper, at you.\n\nYou keeping up?\n\nIt is not unkind. It is a filter.\n\nA patient groans behind the curtain. The resident pushes it aside, steps in, and takes control in three sentences. When she looks at you again, her face is calm but her eyes are sharp.\n\nYou realize something: she does not care if you like her. She cares if you are useful.\n\nAnd still, there is an edge to her attention that is not purely clinical.\n\n----------------\nCHOICES\n1) KEEP PACE - You answer fast, move fast, and accept that you may be wrong for a second as long as you correct fast. It makes you look fearless, and it might get someone hurt.\n2) ASK CLARITY - You slow just enough to confirm your reasoning. You protect the patient and your credibility, but you risk looking soft under pressure.\n3) TAKE INITIATIVE - You propose the next step before she asks. If you are right, you earn her respect. If you are wrong, you earn her memory.\n4) STAY QUIET - You watch and absorb without pushing. You avoid mistakes in public, but you also give up the chance to stand out.",

The nurse leans in, voice low, and the shouting drops to a ragged whisper. She is good at this. Not just medicine. People.\n\nYou help restrain, clean, steady. Then you notice a charting shortcut on the computer: a time stamp that is not exact, a box checked because it will be checked later. Not dangerous, but not clean.\n\nYour eyes flick to her.

Not loudly. Not formally. But enough. You get looped into conversations you used to overhear from the hall. You are asked opinions instead of given instructions. Nothing illegal. Nothing explicit. Just influence.\n\nThe resident starts trusting you with cases that matter. The nurse watches you carefully now, like she is deciding whether you are dangerous or useful or both.\n\nYour rival notices the shift. He does not comment. That makes it worse.\n\nThis path is efficient.\n\nIt is also slippery.\n\nEvery time you say yes, it gets easier to say it again.\n\n----------------\nCHOICES\n1) DOUBLE DOWN - You continue leveraging the momentum and accept bigger asks. This accelerates status but compounds risk and moral erosion.\n2) CONTROL DAMAGE - You slow the pace and start choosing only favors that cannot burn you later. You keep power while limiting exposure.\n3) LOOP SOMEONE IN - You quietly bring one person into your confidence to stabilize the situation. Shared knowledge can protect or destroy you.\n4) STEP BACK - You deliberately reduce visibility before things escalate further. You lose momentum but regain control.",
